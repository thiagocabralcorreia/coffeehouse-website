                <p>In 1986, Coffee House was born. The first store opened in a small town far far away, on the edge of a dirt road, beside a modest farm, where there was a coffee plantation that is now miles long (a piece of heaven with free entry: you are always welcome).</p>
                <p>We have believed in the power of coffee since the beginning of our history. Coffee provides a complex blend of color, aroma and flavor, wakes us up, is a big source of dietary antioxidants and protects against various diseases. Itâ€™s a magic drink, right? That's why we love serving this.</p>
                <p>We sow and harvest the coffee, then carefully select each bean for roasting. After all, every fresh cup of coffee should be a wonderful experience.</p>
