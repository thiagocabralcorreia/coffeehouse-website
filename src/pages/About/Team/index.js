                <p>Well, it's not a big team: it's just me, <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/thiago-cabral-correia/' target='_blank' rel="noreferrer">Thiago Correia</a>. I created this imaginary company to use in my front-end web development project. So, in addition to building this website, I elaborated this cafe with a generic name and a simple brand. Also I designed the graphic arts using and editing Freepik mockups, Unsplah images and Pexels videos. I really hope you enjoyed my work.</p>
